// A lot of details about the communication protocol are unknown,
//   and would be necessary to complete this implementation properly:
// - What does the adapter respond if sending a start session packet with
//     contents _other_ than "NINTENDO"? Is it always echoed back?
// - What is the effect of calling a number starting with a `#` sign?
//     (Dan Docs mentions it always starts with this character, however, when
//     calling someone with PokÃ©mon Crystal, this character isn't included)
//     It seems to only be included for the 4-digit numbers.
// - What does the adapter respond when starting a session without ending the
//     previous one?
// - Similarly, what does it respond when ending a ession without starting one?
// - What does the adapter respond to packets sent _before_ "beginning" a
//     session? (Try Telephone Status, Read Config Data, Wait For Call,
//     ISP Login, Transfer Data and End Session packets, at least).
// - What does the adapter respond to ISP Login and Dial Telephone when no
//     phone is connected/connection fails?
// - What does the adapter respond to Transfer Data if no connection has been
//     made?
// - Under what circumstances is the line "busy"? Is it only when connecting,
//     or when connected, and does the difference between 0x04 and 0x05 have
//     anything to do with TCP vs Call?
// - What does the adapter respond if we try to read/write beyond the 0xC0
//     configuration size boundary?
